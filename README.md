# Traveller's Story

Keep your travel story in photos and share trips and trick from around the world

## Application concept

The app gives the user an easy and enjoyable way to keep track of their journeys and share their stories with the Traveller's community if they like. It fixes the problem of always postponing the ordering of the joyney photos when they have time at home. Also it prevents from forgeting the details they wanted to add to the picture.

It would be like a personal travel diary where stories are kept. Each story consists of a title, a set of photos with small description/note , date and place, and other notes inbetween. All notes are up to 150 symbols, used just to add more clarity to the story.

It would be valuable to the iPhone users as they are already used to taking photos while travelling with their iPhones. The cell phone cameras are now able to take quality pictures and allow for easy sharing on the sicial networks (facebook, instagram...)Having the photos on their devices it would be easier to order them in a short story directly in the mobile app, than to wait until they are able to open their laptops/macbooks at a place with wi-fi, download the photos and again upload them in a web app alike. To share the story with the community will be also easy.
